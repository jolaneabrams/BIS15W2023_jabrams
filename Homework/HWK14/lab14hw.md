## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

Data Scientists can start with a bachelor's degree and the field is expected to grow 36% between 2021 and 2031. 


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

I have experience with Data Science using R Studio. While I am by no means an expert, I can do some basic data analyses and plot their results with reasonable competence given enough time and resources. 

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

I hope to do a master's degree in neuroimaging and neuroinformatics, in which R is used frequently. I wanted to get a head start in this aspect of my training. It may also make me more attractive as a prospective PhD student in the future. 


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

The pace of the class has been grueling for me. I've not been able to digest one set of concepts before we've moved on to the next. 
I do like making attractive plots, and I thought the shiny apps were fun. 


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class?

I started from absolute scratch with R. I had a little exposure to the Unix shell, but that was all as far as coding experience was concerned. I wish I'd had some previous experience with R so that I wouldn't feel so lost and frustrated. 


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I'm still trying to digest everything we've done already. 


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

Part of me would like to repeat this class, so that I can actually understand what I'm doing. I might go over all the class material again at my own speed, so that I can know what commands to use when. Maybe when I have a better handle on the basics, I would be prepared to learn more. 


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I didn't really benefit from working with a partner until we started the group projects. The people who knew what they were doing always finished so fast that they were gone before I made much headway. I was able to ask Akshanth for help on the second midterm, which kept me from being completely bereft. 


9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Not yet. I'll do it as soon as I turn this in.
